        My love for woodworking began when I was just 9 years old. My father suffered from a heart
        attack and although he recovered, he was unable to exert himself or climb a ladder to repair
        things around the house. He would tell me how to fix something and I would do it - I loved
        those times with him. This led me to making small projects out of whatever wood I could find
        and building treehouses in the yard. In the ninth grade I went to a vocational High School
        and started working after school at a hardware store at 14 years old; I was stocking
        shelves, making keys, and cutting glass. When I recognized a talented carpenter in my
        travels, I would say “I like what you do, I want to work for you. I’ll take whatever you
        give me and you can fire me whenever you want”. That’s a compliment to a talented
        craftsperson. It got me in the door. I worked for them and learned some of what they knew.
        I've done contract work since my 20s: I worked as a permanent carpenter at City College (the
        first CUNY school), Metropolitan Hospital, Coney Island Hospital, and more recently for the
        City of New York at City Hall. For the past 40 years I have been lucky enough to get paid to
        do what I would be doing for enjoyment. Now I’m contracting fine kitchen and bathroom
        remodels with a focus on elegant, period reproduction front-entry doors, porch handrails,
        and multi-species reproduction parquet floor borders. When people explain to me what they
        want, I show them a photo gallery of my work to show them things I've done and could do for
        them. I'll let them know they can speak to anyone I've worked for and ask them whatever you
        like. I’d love it if you share with me your dream design - I can help you make it a reality.
